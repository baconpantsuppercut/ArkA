# Arka Front-End Clients

This folder contains reference implementations of Arka clients, including:

- **Arka Play** (general-purpose video viewer)
- **Arka Kids** (AI-guided, neurodiverse-friendly child experience)
- Example UI prototypes
- HTML/JS MVP clients

Early development will focus on:

1. A simple MVP web client that:
   - Reads a static JSON index
   - Displays a list of videos
   - Streams videos from IPFS or HTTP

2. A safe, minimal Arka Kids mockup

Front-end contributors of all experience levels are welcome.
