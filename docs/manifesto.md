# Arka Manifesto

Arka is a community-built attempt to redefine how video exists on the internet.

We believe:

## 1. People deserve access to uncensored, unmanipulated expression.
Video has become one of the most powerful forms of communication, yet most
platforms today control:
- what can be seen
- how it is ranked
- which creators are allowed to thrive
- and which truths are allowed to exist

Arka rejects this.

Arka does not exist to censor.  
Arka does not exist to manipulate.  
Arka exists to **enable sovereignty.**

## 2. Creators deserve ownership, not extraction.
Creators should keep their content, their audience, and their income.  
Platforms should not be gatekeepers or landlords.

Arka aims for:
- creator-controlled monetization
- portable identity
- transparent algorithms
- permissionless publishing

## 3. Children and neurodiverse individuals deserve better digital experiences.
The modern algorithm is optimized for:
- watch time
- addiction
- stimulation

Not learning.  
Not development.  
Not safety.

Arka will include alternative clients like **Arka Kids** — designed for:
- developmental growth
- neurodiverse needs
- sensory-appropriate pacing
- parent-centered controls
- no algorithmic exploitation

## 4. Open protocols create healthy ecosystems.
The internet flourished because protocols (HTTP, SMTP, TCP/IP) were open.

Arka seeks to do the same for video:
- open schemas
- open metadata
- open discovery
- open clients
- open governance

Centralized platforms can be captured.  
Protocols belong to the world.

## 5. Hardware should serve people, not the other way around.
Kids and special-needs individuals often need:
- locked-down devices
- rugged physical protection
- simplified interfaces
- predictable feedback

Arka intends to explore open device concepts that pair with its software ecosystem.

## 6. The community decides the future.
Arka is not a corporation.  
It is not controlled by one person or one company.

Anyone may:
- contribute
- fork
- build clients
- propose changes
- improve the protocol
- shape the culture

This is a collective effort.

## 7. Arka is a seed.
This project begins small — as documents, ideas, prototypes.

It will grow through the hands of the people who believe the world needs:
- a place for uncensored truth  
- a place for creators to thrive  
- a safe refuge for children  
- an open ecosystem that no single entity can control

**you are invited.**
