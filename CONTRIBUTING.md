# Contributing to arkA

Thanks for your interest in arkA — an open, host-anywhere, vendor-neutral video protocol.

This project is in an early exploratory stage. We are actively looking for contributors with interests in:
- Web video formats & streaming
- Privacy-respecting data design
- Indexing/discovery models (IPFS, RSS-style, HTTPS)
- Decentralized hosting
- Static web client UI/UX
- Security, encryption models, capability-based access control
- Schema design (JSON Schema)

## How to Participate

### 🧠 1. Read the Core Documents
Start with:
- `/schema/manifesto.md`
- `/schema/mvp.md`
- `/schema/index-schema.json`
- `/docs/roadmap.md` (if exists)

These describe why arkA exists and what problems it solves.

### 🐛 2. File Issues
Open an issue for:
- Questions
- Proposed design changes
- Feature ideas
- Privacy models
- Reference client improvements

Use the appropriate template to keep discussion productive.

---

### 🔧 3. Make a Pull Request
1. Fork the repo  
2. Create a feature branch  
3. Ensure `npm run lint` passes  
4. Ensure schema validation passes  
5. Submit a PR describing the change and the rationale  

Small, focused PRs are preferred.

### 🛡️ 4. Principles
arkA is built on:
- **Simplicity** — minimum viable protocol first  
- **Host-anywhere** — static, lightweight, replicable  
- **Privacy options** — open access or token-capabilities  
- **Interoperability** — any platform can implement it  

Contributors are expected to follow these guiding ideas.

### 💬 Community
All discussion for now happens on GitHub:
- Issues (design + feedback)
- Pull Requests (implementation)
- Discussions (when enabled)

No Discord/Slack yet — everything stays transparent and archived.

Thank you for helping shape arkA.  
This protocol gets better every time someone brings their perspective.
